# Smart Bin - Role-Based Authentication Setup

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Copy your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. Update `src/lib/supabase.ts` with your actual credentials:

```typescript
const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = 'your-actual-anon-key-here'
```

4. Run the SQL schema from `database-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor

### 2. Authentication Setup (Clerk)

1. Keep your existing Clerk setup in `.env.local`
2. The app will automatically create users in the database when they sign up
3. Default role is "member" - change it in the admin panel

### 3. User Roles

The system has 3 user roles:

- **Member**: Basic user, can view nearby bins and report issues
- **Agent Municipal**: Can manage collections and monitor bin status
- **Chef Municipal**: Full admin access, can manage users and system settings

### 4. How to Change User Roles

1. Sign up as a user (default role: member)
2. A Chef Municipal can access `/dashboard/admin` to change user roles
3. Or manually update the role in the Supabase database

### 5. Dashboard Access

- **Main Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - Shows user role and quick actions
- **Member Dashboard**: `/dashboard/member` - Only accessible to members
- **Agent Dashboard**: `/dashboard/agent-municipal` - Only accessible to agents
- **Chef Dashboard**: `/dashboard/chef-municipal` - Only accessible to chefs
- **Admin Panel**: `/dashboard/admin` - Only accessible to chefs, for role management

### 8. Next Steps

1. Update the Supabase connection details in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
2. Run the database schema
